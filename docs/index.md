Arganic: Decorators for Enhanced Arguments Handling
in Python Classes, Methods and Functions

Arganic is a Python library that provides a
comprehensive set of decorators for managing classes,
methods, and functions with advanced features such as
required parameters, validators, type checking,
read/write accesses, default values, and choices.
By leveraging Python's '*args' and '**kwargs', Arganic
empowers developers to enhance the functionality of
their codebase with ease.

## Key Features:

 - **Decorators for Classes, Methods, and Functions**: Apply decorators to classes, methods, and functions to extend their functionality and behavior.
 - **Required Parameters:** Define required parameters for methods and functions to ensure essential inputs are provided.
 - **Validator Support:** Validate method arguments, function parameters, and class properties using built-in or custom validators.
 - **Type Checking:** Enforce type constraints and ensure type consistency with flexible type checking capabilities.
 - **Read/Write Access Control:** Define read-only or write-only properties for classes, methods, and functions as needed.
 - **Default Values:** Set default values for function arguments, method parameters, and class properties to streamline code logic.
 - **Choice Selection:** Specify a list of choices for method arguments and function parameters, restricting input values to predefined options.
